# October 2022 MICA Challenge

The goal of this week's exercise is to

- Fork this repo to your own GitHub account
- Create a branch for your change with a name of your choice
- Make the change: add a textfile to the repo with your name as file title and your email as content
- Add, commit & push those changes back to GitHub (in the right branch)
- Create a pull request towards the original repo to have your file included
