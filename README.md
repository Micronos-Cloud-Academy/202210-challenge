# October 2022 MICA Challenge

The goal of this week's exercise is to

a) Fork this repo to your own GitHub account
b) Create a branch for your change with a name of your choice
c) Make the change: add a textfile to the repo with your name as file title and your email as content
d) Add, commit & push those changes back to GitHub (in the right branch)
e) Create a pull request towards the original repo to have your file included
